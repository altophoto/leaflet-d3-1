## What we will cover
1. Quick introduction to getting started on coding your own page
2. Links to some helpful javascript libraries
3. Getting data (and working with it in its original format)
4. Walk through key bits of code

The example uses education data, but I'm not really pulling any insights from it. I'm hoping that you will do that! These are tools that you can use to put together interactive pages so non-technical people can easily interact with the data you want them to focus on. For example, you could filter and only show charter schools if you want to focus on the impact they have to traditional schools.

# Please take this example and make it into something meaningful for you!
